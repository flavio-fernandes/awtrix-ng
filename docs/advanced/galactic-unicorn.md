# Galactic Unicorn

AWTRIX NG runs on Pimoroni's fixed **53×11 RGB Galactic Unicorn**, using the
same HTTP and MQTT `/api/v1` command semantics as the ESP32 builds. Pick the
image for the microcontroller actually fitted to your board:

| Hardware | PlatformIO environment | USB image | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pico W, RP2040, 264 KB SRAM, 2 MB flash | `galactic_unicorn` | `firmware-galactic-unicorn.uf2` | Hardware-verified on a real Galactic Unicorn |
| Pico 2 W, RP2350, 520 KB SRAM, 4 MB flash | `galactic_unicorn_2w` | `firmware-galactic-unicorn-2w.uf2` | Compile-only; untested on hardware |

Both reserve **512 KiB for LittleFS**, separate from the application. The
PlatformIO build's reported RAM denominator excludes memory reserved by the
framework. Neither board has external PSRAM. Battery and environmental sensor
values are omitted when the hardware is absent; the onboard light sensor is
available. Do not select an ESP32 image or use its runtime GPIO presets.

## Flash over USB

1. Obtain the UF2 for your Pico version. A source build uses
   `pio run -e galactic_unicorn` or `pio run -e galactic_unicorn_2w`; its output is
   `.pio/build/<environment>/firmware.uf2`. CI's `uf2-<environment>` artifact also
   contains `firmware.uf2`, so keep track of which artifact you downloaded.
2. Disconnect power. Hold the Pico's **BOOTSEL** button while connecting a USB
   **data** cable to your computer, then release it. This is BOOTSEL on the Pico,
   not A/B/C/D or the panel's Sleep button.
3. Drag and drop the matching `.uf2` onto the mounted boot drive (`RPI-RP2` for
   Pico W, `RP2350` for Pico 2 W). Let the copy finish. The drive disappears and
   the board restarts automatically.
4. Subsequent updates use the same procedure. A normal application UF2 keeps
   LittleFS settings and files when its flash layout is unchanged; back them up
   first. Do not use a full-flash erase image unless you intend to erase them.

Browser OTA is not implemented: `POST /update` returns `503 unavailable` and
instructs you to use BOOTSEL/UF2. An ESP32 `.bin` is not interchangeable with UF2.

## First boot and provisioning

The panel shows the boot animation and, without saved Wi-Fi credentials, an
animated **AP MODE** screen. Join the open **awtrixng-xxxxxx** network (`xxxxxx`
is the last three MAC bytes), or the configured hostname if it was changed.
Keep the phone connected even though this setup network has no Internet.

Open **http://192.168.4.1/** if the captive portal does not open. Select or type
your 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi SSID, enter its password and save. Use **Reboot** to join
immediately. Alternatively disconnect the phone: AP retries pause while it is
attached, then retry the saved network and reboot after a successful join.
Hold **B / SELECT for one second during boot** to force setup mode without
erasing credentials.

Rejoin your normal network and open **http://awtrixng-xxxxxx.local/** (or the
configured hostname/port). Use the router's DHCP lease list if mDNS is
unavailable. `/api/v1/device` reports the address and connection state. Configure
MQTT and Home Assistant discovery in System as on an Ulanzi; the shared discovery
and command protocol are unchanged. NTP and the configured time zone set the
clock after joining. There is no battery-backed clock.

## Buttons

Buttons are active-low, debounced for 35 ms. The extra keys act once per press,
not repeatedly while held.

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A | Previous app / left |
| B | Select; dismiss a notification; double press within 300 ms toggles panel power |
| C | Next app / right |
| D | Unmapped |
| Brightness + / − | Step `brightness` by 10, clamped to 0–255; select manual brightness |
| Volume + / − | Step `buzzerVolume` by 5, clamped to 0–100 |
| Sleep | Toggle panel power; this is not timed device sleep |

Navigation follows the shared rotate/swap and `blockNavigation` rules. A/B/C
emit the same button events and `buttonCallback` HTTP webhook payloads as ESP32
(`left`, `middle`, `right`, press and release). See the
[pin map and electrical details](galactic-unicorn-display.md#inputs).

The onboard I²S speaker plays RTTTL: use `sound` for a saved melody or
`soundRtttl` for inline notes. It reports the **buzzer** capability, not MP3 or
DFPlayer. Volume keys and `buzzerVolume` control that same output.

## Feature availability

Always read **`GET /api/v1/capabilities`**, rather than inferring features from a
chip name. This branch's Pico builds currently compile out the following:

| Feature | Reason / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Berry scripting | The initial memory-constrained port omits the VM and its platform workers. `scripting` is false and script routes return `503 unavailable`. |
| MP3 playback and Internet radio | The port supplies a bounded RTTTL tone sink, not the decoder/streaming audio pipeline; their audio flags are false. |
| Outbound TLS | No secure-client integration in the Pico transport; use a trusted local network and supported plain-HTTP endpoints. |
| Browser OTA | No dual-slot updater for the Pico flash layout; update with USB UF2 instead. |

`PUT /api/v1/system` still **accepts and stores `scriptingEnabled`** on a build
without scripting, but the setting is inert: it cannot add code that was compiled
out. The UI hides Run scripts and the script pages, showing “not available on
this board”; MP3/radio sections and their controls follow their own capability
flags. Builds with these capabilities keep the existing controls. A separate
scripting port can therefore enable them without chip-name checks in the UI.

HTTP Basic authentication is not encryption. Do not expose this device directly
to the Internet. Feature-disabled routes retain the shared error vocabulary,
not a second Pico-only API.

## Sleep emulation

`POST /api/v1/device/sleep` blanks the panel, enables radio power saving and waits
for `durationMs` or a new press of **Sleep / GPIO27**. A key already held must be
released before it can wake the device. The CPU, RAM and panel-refresh hardware
stay powered and application/network request handling pauses; this is **not
ESP32 deep sleep** or a low-microamp shutdown. Wake restarts the application and
reports `resetReason: "software"`. Ordinary panel-power toggling leaves the
application and networking running. The hardware watchdog still protects a
hung application and reports `watchdog` after recovery.

## Eleven rows and the tall-panel rule

`panelHeight` defaults to **11**, with fixed width **53**. Height **8** is a
compatibility mode letterboxed on physical rows 1–8. Other heights fall back to
11 at board startup with a warning; generic configurable-panel ranges do not
change the Unicorn's physical wiring.

The shared tall-panel rule centres ordinary text, primary 8×8 icons and built-in
apps in an eight-row band starting at `floor((H - 8) / 2)` (row 1 at height 11).
Backgrounds, effects, overlays, transitions and charts use the whole canvas;
progress is on its last row. Draw commands and explicitly positioned icons use
absolute coordinates. GIFs keep their own dimensions. See
[Limits](../reference/limits.md#tall-panels-content-band-and-full-canvas).

## Verification scope

Verified on **Pico W** hardware: display/light sensor/fps, HTTP
smoke testing (106 passed, 0 failed), 80 concurrent requests, watchdog recovery,
MQTT and real Home Assistant discovery (21 entities), Matrix light control,
notifications, A/B/C events, brightness, volume, Sleep, and hearing the `alert`
melody. The button **webhook** remains host/simulator-tested only. The Pico 2 W
has **no hardware verification**. Firmware compilation and host tests cannot
establish physical timing or audio quality on that board.

See [driver details](galactic-unicorn-display.md) and
[LittleFS persistence](pico-persistence.md) for implementation constraints.
