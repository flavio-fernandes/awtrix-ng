# Native simulator effect survey

Run in the build container from the repository root after building `native_sim`:

```console
python tools/sim/effect_survey.py --size 32x8 --size 53x11 --out .pio/effect-survey
```

The tool starts an isolated simulator per size using a temporary `device.json`, enumerates
`/api/v1/capabilities`, holds an empty-text notification for each effect, and samples
`/api/v1/display/screen`. It writes one scaled PNG strip per effect, plus `summary.md`
and `summary.json`. PNG encoding uses only Python's standard library. The simulator is
terminated and temporary device data removed even on failure.

Defaults: 12 frames, 250 ms interval, 500 ms settling time, 4x nearest-neighbour scaling.
`--frames`, `--interval`, `--settle`, `--scale`, `--port`, and `--program` are configurable.
Rows are zero-based; lit/changing rows are unions over the sampled frames. These are
wall-clock observations, not a whole-cycle guarantee or deterministic golden snapshots.
Sparse effects and periodic sampling can omit rows or repeat frames. Use host tests for
frame-exact coverage and determinism assertions.

## Tall-panel effects

- BrickBreaker, Snake and PingPong are mini-games on every panel size. Each replays a
  round from a fixed start: at most 511 constant-cost ticks per frame, and the round
  restarts every 512 effect frames (about 34 s at the steady rate). The bounded replay makes
  seeking, dropped frames and repeated calls deterministic; state is fixed-size.
- BrickBreaker: bricks are 3 LEDs with a 1-LED gap, centred; 2 rows, 3 from 11 rows up,
  one hue per row. The ball moves one LED at a time and stops on a hit, so a tick removes
  exactly one brick and the ball never stands on one; it passes through the gap columns. The
  3-LED paddle tracks the ball with an aim offset: a centre contact returns at 45 degrees,
  an edge contact shallow (2 across per 1 down). An empty wall refills at the paddle.
- Snake: greedy steering towards a food pixel (Manhattan distance, avoiding its body and
  dead ends) on a field of up to 64x32 cells. Food rows walk a per-round permutation of the
  rows, columns come from `noise::hash2`, and a raster probe skips the body. Length 4 grows
  by one per food; a stuck or 24-long snake starts a new game at once.
- PingPong: paddles on columns 0 and w-1 (3 LEDs, 4 from 11 rows up) always cover the ball's
  row; the receiving one steers to an aim point, the other lags. The paddle edge returns
  45 degrees, the middle (or a corner) shallow.
- SwirlIn/SwirlOut use two rotating elliptical spiral packets sized to the canvas.
  Radial phase moves particles inward/outward; particles wrap at the centre/outer edge.
  Contraction deliberately narrows the image during part of the cycle. This is not a
  fixed-width guarantee at every frame.
- These renderers use no per-frame heap allocation and no platform-specific APIs.

`test/test_tall_effects` checks brick geometry (3 lit, 1 dark), one brick per hit, a
ball never on a brick, ball coverage over more than half the rows and both slopes; food
never on the snake, growth by one with moving food, mostly-closing distance, no
overlapping segments and full-height snake coverage; both PingPong paddles covering the
ball at columns 1 and w-2 and both slopes; swirl width above 70% at the
reference frame and opposite mean-radius movement over a short window. Determinism
and framebuffer guard sentinels (including PingPong) cover widths 4/32/53/64/80 and every height 8 through 16.
Guard sentinels verify no out-of-buffer memory writes; Canvas itself drops out-of-range
coordinates. This does not instrument attempted clipped draws.

## E1 visual review

Before/after strips and complete survey tables are attached to board card `t_18fdeb50`,
not checked in as generated assets. Reviewed all 19 effects at 53x11 and the four changed
effects at 32x8. BrickBreaker now visibly separates ball from paddle and removes bricks;
Snake traverses the height; swirls contract/expand over the panel width instead of
remaining a small clipped central cluster.

The other 15 effects were left unchanged:

| Effect | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Checkerboard | Full-canvas alternating tiles; odd edge dimensions naturally crop a tile. |
| ColorWaves | Full-height colour bands, no blank band or misplaced centre. |
| Fade | Uniform whole-canvas fade; near-black frames are intentional. |
| Fireworks | Small expanding bursts at varying locations; edge cropping is natural. |
| LookingEyes | Recognisable centred pair with gaze/blink; explicitly excluded from changes. |
| Matrix | Falling heads/trails across the whole canvas. |
| MovingLine | Full-height line scanning horizontally. |
| Pacifica | Smooth full-canvas water pattern. |
| PingPong | Single point moving in both axes; sparse sampling is not unused height. (E2 later made it a paddle game.) |
| Plasma | Full-canvas multicolour field. |
| PlasmaCloud | Full-canvas smooth cloud field. |
| Radar | Centred rotating ray; circular sweep meets rectangular panel edges naturally. |
| Ripple | Centred expanding circular rings; top/bottom cropping is intentional expansion. |
| TheaterChase | Repeated full-height chase bars. |
| TwinklingStars | Sparse distributed twinkles; no requirement to populate every row in a short sample. |

These are simulator observations, not a replacement for human inspection on the Unicorn.
